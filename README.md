## 📂 Topics Covered

### 1. **File Operations**
- Reading and writing files
- Appending data
- File handling functions in C
- **Example**:
    ```c
    FILE *fp;
    fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening file!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    fclose(fp);
    ```

### 2. **Memory Management**
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`)
- Freeing memory
- Preventing memory leaks

### 3. **Data Structures**
- Implementations of linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.
- **Example**:
    ```c
    typedef struct Node {
        int data;
        struct Node *next;
    } Node;
    ```

### 4. **Pointers**
- Pointer basics and arithmetic
- Function pointers and their uses

### 5. **Threads**
- Multithreading using `pthread`
- Synchronization mechanisms (mutex, read-write locks)

### 6. **Networking**
- Socket programming basics
- TCP and UDP communication

### 7. **System Programming**
- Signals and process forking
- Inter-process communication

### 8. **Debugging**
- Using `gdb` and `valgrind` effectively
