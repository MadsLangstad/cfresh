# Advanced File Operations in C

This directory contains advanced file operation examples in C, demonstrating techniques beyond basic file reading and writing. The provided examples include:

- **binary_file_handling.c**: Handling binary files for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **file_permissions.c**: Managing file permissions using system calls.
- **file_streams.c**: Utilizing different file streams for versatile file operations.
- **memory_mapped_files.c**: Implementing memory-mapped files for high-performance file access.

## Contents

### `binary_file_handling.c`

Demonstrates how to read from and write to binary files using `fread` and `fwrite`.

### `file_permissions.c`

Shows how to modify file permissions using the `chmod` system call.

### `file_streams.c`

Explores the use of various file streams (`FILE*`) for different file operations.

### `memory_mapped_files.c`

Illustrates how to use `mmap` for mapping files into memory for faster access.

## Compilation Instructions

To compile any of the examples, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o <output_executable> <source_file.c>
Example:

bash
Copy code
gcc -o binary_file_handling binary_file_handling.c
Usage
After compiling, run the executable with any required arguments.

Example:

bash
Copy code
./binary_file_handling
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create, read, or modify files as required by each example.

Notes
These examples are intended for educational purposes to illustrate advanced file operations in C.
Make sure to handle files carefully to avoid data loss, especially when dealing with binary data and file permissions.
